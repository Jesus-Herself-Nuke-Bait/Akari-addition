			+"<li>Combat update (PR#916 by Irbynx):</li>"
			+"<ul>Completely overhauled combat loop.</ul>"
			+"<ul>The old turn based system has been modified into an action-point based turn system.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Added blocking/shielding system, along with a few basic attack moves.</ul>"
			+"<ul>You are now able to see intents of enemies and allies in combat.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Abilities available to any character in combat are limited to maximum of 8 - respective menu added to phone to assign abilities, and to companion/slave management to manage theirs.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Combat AI is a little smarter now, although improvements can be made.</ul>"
			+"<ul>HP formula changed to avoid physique playing a major role in it.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Mana formula changed to overally bring the amount of mana to 100-120 average values.</ul>"

			+"<ul>'Defence modifier' has been added as an attribute, and applies a boost or drain to damage shielding for the character at the start of each combat turn.</ul>"
			+"<ul>'Dodge chance' and 'Miss chance' have been removed from the game. Spells and other effects that modified 'Dodge chance' or 'Miss chance' have been converted into a positive or negative 'Defence modifier' value, respectively.</ul>"
			+"<ul>The extra effect of the spell 'Rain Cloud', 'Cloud burst', is now triggered by being hit by a critical attack, instead of being triggered by missing an attack.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Special tease attacks now do limited damage vs enemies who dislike the associated fetish. (i.e. Doing a 'virility tease' on someone who dislikes the 'pregnancy' fetish will only do 1 damage.)</ul>"
			+"<ul>You can now set an allied and enemy target, so you don't have to keep on switching target to cast friendly spells/abilities.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Beneficial spells & abilities will now automatically be applied to your allied target, whereas detrimental spells, abilities, and attacks will be applied to your enemy target.</ul>"
			+"<ul>The main three stat bars (physique/arcane/corruption) are now hidden during combat, so that it's easier to see multiple combatant's stats.</ul>"

			+"<li>Bugs:</ul>"
			+"<ul>Typo/parsing fixes.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed issue with incorrect names being parsed in speech.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed an issue with names sometimes being parsed as though they were within speech when they weren't.</ul>"

		+ "<br/>"

		+ "<list>"
			+ "<h6>v0.3.3.6</h6>"
			+"<li>Engine:</li>"
			+"<ul>Moved Perk Enums into classes.</ul>"
			
			+"<li>Gameplay:</li>"
			+"<ul><b>All permanent attribute boosts for all characters will be reset upon loading into the game.</b></ul>"
			+"<ul><b>All characters' perk trees will be reset upon loading into the game.</b></ul>"
			+"<ul>You can no longer gain permanent increases to your attributes through potions. The only way to increase attributes now is through clothing, status effects, perks, or unique events.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Removed base attribute increases for races, and instead put attribute bonuses in subspecies' unique status effects.</ul>"
			+"<ul>The perk trees for all non-elementals (including that of the player) have been modified. Added several new traits and perks, and the 'root' lust perk is now unlocked by default.</ul>"
			+"<ul>You can no longer go 'back up' the perk tree to unlock perks. All unlock progress must now always be down or on the same level.</ul>"
			+"<ul>All NPCs no longer have attributes assigned to them upon creation, and instead select perks based on their subspecies's preferences.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Characters who are enslaved no longer have their job-related trait converted into the slave trait. Characters who spawn into the game as slaves will have the slave trait, however.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Altered aura calculation to rely more on the value of your arcane attribute.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Resistance attributes no longer provide a percentage damage reduction, and instead provide shielding equal to their value in each turn in combat.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Clothing now provides 10% of the physical resistance it used to. (For any modders, please continue to use integer values of 1 and over - the reduction to 10% is done in the code.)</ul>"
			
			+"<li>Other:</li>"
			+"<ul>You can now see NPCs' perk trees at the bottom of their character description pages.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Amber now has two demonstones equipped as weapons.</ul>"

			+"<ul>Brax/Bree/Brandi no longer wears shoes.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Adjusted the levels of several unique NPCs.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Reduced clothing attribute modifiers from -5/-3/-1/1/3/5 to -3/-2/-1/1/2/3.</ul>"
			
			+"<li>More combat changes:</li>"
			+"<ul>Added status effect application indication in combat moves tooltips.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Changed spell's critical hit requirement to being the only action used that turn.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Changed the colour of the 'lust' attribute from scarlet to light pink, and 'physical damage' from red to grey-brown.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Removed 'critical chance' and 'bonus lust shielding' attributes. Altered status effects, subspecies bonues, and clothing enchantments which used these attributes. Enchanted clothing/weapons which had critical chance modifiers have been converted to critical damage.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Renamed 'critical hit damage' to 'critical power'.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Added shielding for energy damage as a separate shielding type from physical.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Block now blocks all energy damage, not just physical.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Racial resistances have been removed. Instead of increasing your stats, race books now give you a unique perk which boosts damage vs that race. (You can get the lilin and elder lilin unique perks by returning to Lyssieth and asking about 'Recap' and 'Family', respectively.)</ul>"
			+"<ul>(If you have defeated the imps in the Imp Citadel, you should have your imp racial damage replaced by a special perk, 'imp slayer', when you load in.)</ul>"
			
			+"<li>Bugs:</li>"
			+"<ul>Tease damage done to a target who is immune to the 'instant-loss at 100 lust' effect will now correctly start to damage their health.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Restored Rose's virginity for if it was accidentally taken in a version where her sex actions weren't working properly.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed issue with player's prediction moves in combat not being cleared each turn.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed move cooldowns not being reset when you used the 'Reset' action in combat.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed combat prediction text not correctly identifying when the move would be a critical.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed issue with characters getting a huge amount of perk points.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed issue in characters' information screens, where relationships sometimes included an 'Unknown'.</ul>"
			+"<ul>Fixed some parsing errors.</ul>"
